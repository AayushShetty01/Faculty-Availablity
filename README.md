# Faculty-Availablity
This website is basically made by me to solve one pf the real-time problems faced by students in their college premises. The old students as well as freshers from the college face the problem of finding the faculty cabin position and also they do not have an idea whether they are free at that time or not. Through our application we have to users accessibility one is for students and other is for the faculty. The faculty can just click on available when they are in their cabin and they can also accept meetings which students have requested for through our website. 


IMPLEMENTATION
1. First, we should make a HOMEPAGE which should consist of options such as Home, 
   About Us, Sign Up, Feedback.
2. So, for creating these options we have to use the following scripting languages: HTML, 
   CSS, JS and PHP for storing the values in the database.
3. We have to code separately for all 4 options connecting different CSS to each one of 
   them and the required PHP programs.
4. Once we create the necessary things, we have to link Login, About Us and Feedback 
   using link statement and reference.
5. Then create a database for storing the info such as name, email, password, block
   number, etc. in PHP in backend.
6. Then we have to create the main workspace in which when the student logins to the 
   homepage, the opening page should consist of dropdown options such as Dept, Date, 
   Time, Reason.
7. We have to store the values or specific values that students give in the reason dropdown 
   menu
8. Then in the date we can give the input as date so that we can get a date option directly.
9. Then in the Dept which all faculty will Sign in their info will be stored in that dropdown.
10.Then in the time dropdown menu we have to give the different timing slots of 20mins 
   which is more than enough to solve the student’s problem.
11.Then we have to store all this info in table format in the php.
12.In SQL, so that the lecture can access and see which students have to meet.
13.The meeting info is stored in table format in the staff working page which also includes a 
   navbar with logo at the left and logout at the right.
   
   
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE
The Conclusion of our project is the day to day problems that students face in class as well as 
in general such as :-
1. Searching the location of the respective teacher’s cabin,
2. The questions that student hesitate to ask in the class can be asked to the faculty 
   separately.
3. Doubts or difficulties that were faced in the class or while doing homework can be 
   discussed.
4. The things or topics that they want to discuss with the respective faculty about the selected 
   project.
5. General problems they face during the lectures such as voice inaudibility, blackboard not 
   visible, distractions or disturbances caused by other students,
6. And many such problems that the students face can be solved or reduced using this 
   website, as this website is easy to use and user-friendly.
7. There is still further scope to improve this project by making a button that can toggle on/off 
   and the teachers can indicate whether they are available or not through this button to the 
   Student side portal.
